#### **Key Sections:**

1. **Setup and Scan Execution:**
   - **Nessus Login:** Initial setup and login to the Nessus vulnerability scanner.
   - **Basic Network Scan:** Creation of a scan profile to assess vulnerabilities across a specified IP range on the home network.
   - **Scan Results:** Analysis of the scan completion and summary of vulnerabilities detected.

2. **Vulnerability Analysis:**
   - **Highest Vulnerability Device:** Detailed examination of the device with the most critical vulnerabilities, including a description of the device, level of vulnerabilities, and recommended actions.
   - **Lowest Vulnerability Device:** Overview of the device with the fewest vulnerabilities, including an analysis of non-critical issues.

3. **Mitigation Strategies:**
   - **Recommended Actions:** Suggestions to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities, including updates and configuration changes.
   - **Solution Evaluation:** Assessment of available solutions and decision-making based on feasibility and impact.

4. **Nessus Features and Challenges:**
   - **Useful Features:** Highlight of the most beneficial features of Nessus, such as detailed security suggestions and comprehensive scan reports.
   - **Challenges Encountered:** Description of the difficulties faced during the scan process, including IP range configuration and scan execution.

#### Example Scan on Home Network:
I performed a local scan and found several vulnerabilities, including an outdated version of Node.js, outdated firmware on my router switch, and SNMP being enabled on the router. After addressing these issues and rescanning, no more vulnerabilities were detected.
